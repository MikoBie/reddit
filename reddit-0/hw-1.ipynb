    "* Get 25 submissions from a Reddit called `todayilearned`\n",
    "* The submissions should be from the day of your last even birthday or earlier, for example, my last even birthday was last year on October 24th, therefore, I would get submissions from either 24th or earlier\n",
    "* The submissions should include word science\n",
